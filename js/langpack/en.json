LCR refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets held by financial institutions, to ensure their ongoing ability to meet short-term obligations. This ratio is a regulatory stress test required by Mexico Central Bank (Banco de Mexico). The importance of this project is that the regulatory authorities only require to maintain a calculation of the LCR with two days of lag, but with this project I managed to obtain intraday data through interfaces with back-office systems, front-office and even systems of third parties, thus obtaining calculations in real time. No other investment bank in Mexico has a tool like this, which gives Credit Suisse a competitive advantage by being able to make immediate decisions to stabilize the value of the LCR.",

In practice, the greatest achievement for <em>&#8220;Rex&#8221;</em> has been to have completely replaced Intellimatch: an existing system of reconciliations made by third parties, and that in addition to being expensive, always offered excessively long development times.",
		"sw_rex_mt_02": "This occurred in the Financial Products Control Area. A peculiarity of this area is that during a normal day of operation, most of its functions are focused on maintaining constant vigilance between the specific operations of Purchases and Sales by the Traders of the Front Office, and the Payments and Collections operations of the Back Office.",
		"sw_rex_mt_03": "In order to fulfill its functions of monitoring the accuracy of the operations generated in both areas, reconciliation tools are required between the data from both the Front Office systems and those of the Back Office; at the time, those reconciliation tools were the responsibility of Intellimatch.",
		"sw_rex_mt_04": "It was then that an event occurred that served as a trigger for management to authorize the development of <em>&#8220;Rex&#8221;</em>. It all started when the Front Office expressed its interest in starting to offer a new product to its clients, called <em>Swaptions</em>.",
		"sw_rex_mt_05": "Every time the Front Office requests the development of a new financial product, there are a whole series of modifications to the existing systems in order for them to be able to carry out both its valuations, as well as correct accounting and reporting of profits and losses to regulatory entities such as the Mexico Central Bank.",
		"sw_rex_mt_06": "One of the most important modifications has to do with enabling the Financial Products Control Area to carry out reconciliations of operations using the new product. Thus it was that this area asked Intellimatch to make an analysis of the time required for them to develop the reconciliation of the Swaptions. The preliminary estimate provided by Intellimatch was 10 months of development.",
		"sw_rex_mt_07": "Several areas expressed their initial rejection of the Intellimatch proposal, as it was almost a year of waiting before the Front Office could begin to offer the product to its customers, but without a reconciliation in the process of development, the green light could not be given to the other areas to implement the product in its entirety.",
		"sw_rex_mt_08": "Seeing then the opportunity to offer a better option, I submitted a rival estimate to carry out internal development, which decreased the estimated time from 10 to 6 months, for a similar price. Of those 6 months of development, the first 4 months would be dedicated exclusively to building the core of <em>&#8220;Rex&#8221;</em>. That is, the development of the configuration, readers, processors and publishers.",
		"sw_rex_mt_09": "What made the difference and meant the success in accepting the new proposal was that the remaining 2 months in development time would be dedicated not only to setting up and implementing reconciliation for Swaptions, but also as part of the same proposal it included the development and migration of the other 19 products that were already being reconciled by Intellimatch, among them: Bonds, Capsfloors, Depos, Equity Options, FX, FX Forwards, Loans, Repos, Swaps, etc.",
		"sw_rex_mt_10": "This meant that in just one fifth of the time required for Intellimatch to develop just 1 product, <em>&#8220;Rex&#8221;</em> was able to achieve full development and migration for 20 products.",
		"sw_rex_mt_11": "In this way, it was not only guaranteed that it would be possible to offer clients operations with Swapciones in a shorter time, improving the possibilities of growing the business quickly. In addition, it also completely eliminated the need to continue paying for Intellimatch's annual license of several thousand dollars, and allowed it to be replaced by internal development, much cheaper in terms of development and support.",
		"sw_rex_mt_12": "This demonstrated the resounding success of the original idea put into practice and served to expand the interest in using <em>&#8220;Rex&#8221;</em> in other types of developments such as the elimination of spreadsheet-based tactical tools, in addition to the development of other data processing applications (not just reconciliations), such as data migration and validation tools.",
		"sw_rex_ex_01": "This is the first draft I made for Rex's UML model. From the beginning I envisioned a design based on interfaces of different types that were implemented by the final objects, which in turn would be instantiated by <em>Reflection</em>:",
		"sw_rex_ex_01_01": "First draft for Rex UML model",
		"sw_rex_ex_02": "The three main interfaces were <code>IDataSource</code>, <code>IDataProcessor</code>, and <code>IDataPublisher</code>; in that order, they were used to implement the data readers, processors, and publishers. The <code>IReconciliator</code> interface was a specialized type of object focused on processing reconciliations, and it made development easier by implementing objects with standardized names and values.",
		"sw_rex_ex_03": "This original design had only one important change afterwards, since I eliminated the <code>IDataFormatter</code> interface, which had the purpose of implementing different formatters for the data outputs, particularly those that would generate reports in Excel. This was no longer necessary as the final requirement could be met simply by creating a custom <em>template</em> in Excel based on a XML schema (.xsd) and dynamically generating it by importing the data from data sources generated in XML format:",

		"sw_rex_ex_05": "But on researching more about <em>Reflection</em> I decided that this would be the ultimate approach to the project (replacing the use of the <em>Factory Method</em> design pattern), as it would give us greater benefits by automatically instantiating entire objects based on XML settings.",
		"sw_rex_ex_14": "To manage the XML configurations repository, I used a content management system called OrchardCMS, which also allows managing access controls based on user profiles for each area associated with a specific application.",

I used <em>Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)</em> to dynamically create instances of existing object types from a XML configuration, and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.",
		"sw_dpf_mt_01": "The development of this project has been motivated essentially by the experience obtained over more than 25 years in different operational areas of financial institutions such as banks, insurers and pension fund managers (<em>Afores</em>). During all that time, I was coming to the conclusion that all these areas had a common denominator, since in each one of them there was a specific subset of activities that involved daily data migration, conversion and exploitation processes; from sources whose format was as diverse as the way to access them.",
		"sw_dpf_mt_02": "As a general rule, these needs were related to tasks such as validations, reconciliations, reports, among others; And there had always been multiple solutions to them: from manual processing, third-party software, to custom developments (both outsourced and home-made).",
		"sw_dpf_mt_03": "A particular problem occurred in the context of custom developments and was directly related to the source code, since generally there was no standardized consensus regarding the programming language, the coding standards; and in general to the development methodology.",
		"sw_dpf_mt_04": "It was then that I managed to identify the main consequences of this problem, and that if it continued like this, they would put at risk the stability of the area, and the continuity of daily processes:",

If we are not agile and work differently, everything we do is going to be two years late."
